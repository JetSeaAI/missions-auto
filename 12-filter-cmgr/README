Mission for testing the handling of filtering out contact behaviors based on the
vsource information associated with the contact. The "vsource" indicates the
source of the contact information, e.g., AIS, ARPA, Radar and so on. For testing
purposes this is set in the pNodeReporter configuration, vsource=ais. Normally
we would not be setting this field in pNodeReporter, and if we did, it would
either be blank, or "ownship".

The mission launches with abe as ownship, and four additional contacts, ben, cal,
deb and eve. Two contacts have a vsource of AIS. They all have a speed of zero,
so nothing moves when the mission is started. 

When the DEPLOY button is hit, abe's helm will have four active collision avoidance
behaviors.

In appcasting if you select abe/pHelmIvP, you should see the four active behaviors:

Behaviors Spawnable: --------- (2)
  BHV_AvdColregsV22::avdcol_ (Spawned:4/4)
  BHV_AvdColregsV22::avdcol2_ (Spawned:0/0)
Behaviors Active: ---------- (5)
  waypt_transit [45.95] (pwt=100) (pcs=8) (cpu=0.85) (upd=0/0)
  avdcol_ben [45.44] (pwt=54.2605) (pcs=75) (cpu=0.85) (upd=1/1)
  avdcol_cal [45.44] (pwt=72.52451) (pcs=840) (cpu=0.85) (upd=1/1)
  avdcol_deb [45.44] (pwt=72.52451) (pcs=840) (cpu=0.86) (upd=1/1)
  avdcol_eve [45.44] (pwt=54.2262) (pcs=81) (cpu=0.86) (upd=1/1)
Behaviors Running: --------- (0)
Behaviors Disabled: --------- (0)
Behaviors Idle: ------------ (2)
  waypt_return[45.95], station-keep[4


If you click the AIS-OFF button, it sends a message to abe's contact manager,
XYZ_DISABLE_TARGET=action=disable,vsource=ais

This will be received by abe's contact manager with a resulting message to the helm
to disable any behaviors with ais as the vsource for it's contact. You should see
the abe/pHelmIvP appcasting output change to the below:

Behaviors Spawnable: --------- (2)
  BHV_AvdColregsV22::avdcol_ (Spawned:4/4)
  BHV_AvdColregsV22::avdcol2_ (Spawned:0/0)
Behaviors Active: ---------- (3)
  waypt_transit [402.80] (pwt=100) (pcs=8) (cpu=8.42) (upd=0/0)
  avdcol_cal [402.29] (pwt=72.52451) (pcs=840) (cpu=8.42) (upd=1/1)
  avdcol_deb [402.29] (pwt=72.52451) (pcs=840) (cpu=8.42) (upd=1/1)
Behaviors Running: --------- (0)
Behaviors Disabled: --------- (2)
  avdcol_ben [5.10]
  avdcol_eve [5.10]
Behaviors Idle: ------------ (2)
  waypt_return[402.80], station-keep[402.80]
Behaviors Completed: ------- (0)

Clicking on the AIS-ON button button should revert to all behaviors being active.
