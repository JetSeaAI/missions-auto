synopsis = In the berta mission two vehicles loiter in opposite east-west
synopsis = locations and then periodically traverse to the opposite location, 
synopsis = creating a collision avoidance situation as they pass. The loiter
synopsis = locations are randomly adjusted in the north-south direction to 
synopsis = create slighly different angles on each crossing approach. The 
synopsis = mission can be run with basic collision avoidance or COLREGS
synopsis = collision avoidance with a command-line switch.
